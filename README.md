# **Think & Build - AR Memory Game**  
**Augmented Reality Video Game Developed in Swift**  

## **Overview**  
Think & Build is an **augmented reality (AR) video game** designed to enhance memory skills by challenging players to construct figures and structures using colorful blocks. The game features four phases of increasing difficulty, each with unique levels that test the player's ability to memorize and replicate patterns. [See demo below](#demo) .

This project was developed as part of personal project while I was beggining to immerse myself into coding and demonstrates my skills in **Swift programming, AR development, and game design**.

## **Features**  
- **4 Types of Blocks:** Red, blue, yellow, and green blocks for building structures.  
- **4 Phases:** Easy, Medium, Hard, and Insane, each with 5 unique levels.  
- **Progressive Difficulty:** Players start with the "Easy" phase and advance as they complete levels.  
- **Randomized Levels:** Only 3 out of 5 levels are randomly selected per phase, ensuring a unique experience each time.  
- **Random Mode:** A special mode where levels are completely randomized, offering unpredictable difficulty—sometimes easy, sometimes very challenging.  
- **Memory Training:** Designed to help students improve their memory skills in a fun and engaging way.

## **How It Works**  
1. Players begin in the **"Easy" phase**, where a prototype figure is displayed for a short time.  
2. The player must memorize the figure and reconstruct it using the available blocks.  
3. After completing 3 randomly selected levels in a phase, the player advances to the next phase.  
4. The game ends when the player successfully completes all 12 levels (3 levels per phase).  
5. **Random Mode:** In this mode, levels are fully randomized, providing a mix of easy and challenging scenarios for an unpredictable and exciting experience.

## **Motivation**  
The goal of this project is to provide students with an entertaining way to **stimulate and improve their memory skills**. By encouraging friendly competition and engagement, Think & Build aims to make memory training an enjoyable and rewarding experience.
